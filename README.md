# conjugate-gradient-cuda-eigen
GPU based implementation of a conjugate gradient method based linear solver using CUDA C++, Thrust and cuBLAS, also featuring Eigen for the purpose of verification and runtime comparison. The aim of this repository is to use high-level, possibly template-based APIs to reduce development time and avoid writing boilerplate code for memory management, cleanup etc.
